As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the radio is not checked action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that a given radio is not checked
Given
	I go to "radio_tests.htm"
When
	#The Page finishes loading
Then
	I see the "chkUnchecked" radio is not checked
	And I see the "chkUnchecked2" radio is not checked
