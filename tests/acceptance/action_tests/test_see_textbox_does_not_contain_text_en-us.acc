As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox does not contain text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page textbox does not contain text
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "txtContains1" textbox does not contain "small"
	And I see "txtContains2" textbox does not contain "small"
	And I see "txtContains3" textbox does not contain "small"
	And I see "txtContains4" textbox does not contain "small"
	And I see "txtContains5" textbox does not contain "small"
	And I see "txtContains6" textbox does not contain "small"
