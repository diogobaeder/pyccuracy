As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see select does not have selected value of action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page's select does not have selected value of "10"
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selNotSelectedByValue" select does not have selected value of "10"
	And I see "selNotSelectedByValue2" select does not have selected value of "10"
