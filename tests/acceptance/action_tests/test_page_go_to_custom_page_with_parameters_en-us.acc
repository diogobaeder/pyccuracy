As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test that I can navigate to a custom page with parameters
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that navigating to a custom page with parameters works
Given
    I go to Yahoo Search for query "Hello World"
When
    #I wait for the page to load
Then
    I see "search" textbox contains "Hello World"

Scenario 2 - Checking that navigating to a custom page with many parameters works
Given
    I go to Other Yahoo Search with query "LOL", offset "11"
When
    #I wait for the page to load
Then
    I see "search" textbox contains "LOL"
    And I see "page" div matches "2"
