As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see div contains markup action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page div contains "<p>some</p>" markup
Given
	I go to "div_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "divContainsMarkup" div contains "<p>some</p>" markup
	And I see "divContainsMarkup" div contains "markup" markup
