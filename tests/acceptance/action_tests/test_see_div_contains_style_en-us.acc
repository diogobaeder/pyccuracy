As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see div contains an specific style
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page div has "some" style
Given
    I go to "div_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I see "divContainsStyle1" div has "blabla" style
    And I see "divContainsStyle2" div has "blabla" style
