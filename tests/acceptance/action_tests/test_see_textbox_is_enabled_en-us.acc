As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox is enabled action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some textbox is enabled
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "txtEnabled1" textbox is enabled
	And I see "txtEnabled2" textbox is enabled
	And I see "txtEnabled3" textbox is enabled
	And I see "txtEnabled4" textbox is enabled
	And I see "txtEnabled5" textbox is enabled
	And I see "txtEnabled6" textbox is enabled
