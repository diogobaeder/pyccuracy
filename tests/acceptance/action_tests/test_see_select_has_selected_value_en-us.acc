As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see select has selected value of action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page's select has selected value of 20
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selSelectedByValue" select has selected value of "20"
