As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the drag div action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that a given div gets drag and dropped
Given
    I go to "drag_tests.htm"
When
    I drag the "dragFrom" div to the "dragTo" div
Then
    I see "dragresult" div contains "Dropped!"
