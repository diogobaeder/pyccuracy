As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see select does not have selected text of action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page's select does not have selected text of "Holy Graal"
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selFirstIndex" select does not have selected text of "Holy Graal"
	And I see "selFirstIndex2" select does not have selected text of "Holy Graal"
