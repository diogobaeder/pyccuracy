As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see link has text of action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page link has the given text
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "lnkGoogle" link contains "Google 1"
	And I see "lnkGoogle2" link contains "Google 2"
