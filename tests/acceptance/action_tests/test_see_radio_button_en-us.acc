As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see radio button action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some radio button is there
Given
	I go to "radio_button_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "rdbSomething" radio button
	And I see "rdbSomething2" radio button
