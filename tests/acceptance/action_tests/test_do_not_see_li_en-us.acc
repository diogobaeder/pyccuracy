As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see li action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page li is not there
Given
    I go to "ul_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I do not see "liHidden1" li
    And I do not see "liHidden2" li
    And I do not see "liHidden3" li
    And I do not see "liHidden4" li
    And I do not see "liHidden5" li
