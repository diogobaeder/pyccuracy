As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see image has src of action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page image has the correct src
Given
	I go to "image_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "imgLogo" image has src of "logo_pyccuracy.gif"
