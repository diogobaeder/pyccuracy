As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test type text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can type the text in the textboxes
Given
    I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
    I slowly fill "txtSomething" textbox with "Spam 1"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomething2" textbox with "Spam 2"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomething3" textbox with "Spam 3"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomethingElse" textbox with "Spam 4"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomethingElse2" textbox with "Spam 5"
    And I slowly fill "txtSomethingElse3" textbox with "Spam 6"
Then
    I see "txtSomething" textbox matches "Spam 1"
    And I see "txtSomething2" textbox matches "Spam 2"
    And I see "txtSomething3" textbox matches "Spam 3"
    And I see "txtSomethingElse" textbox matches "Spam 4"
    And I see "txtSomethingElse2" textbox matches "Spam 5"
    And I see "txtSomethingElse3" textbox matches "Spam 6"
