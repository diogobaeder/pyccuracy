As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see image action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page image is not there
Given
    I go to "image_tests.htm"
When    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I do not see "imgHidden" image
    And I do not see "imgHidden2" image
    And I do not see "imgHidden3" image
    And I do not see "imgHidden4" image
    And I do not see "imgHidden5" image
