As a Pyccuracy User
I want to see the markup of current page
So that I can check if its markup contains something

Scenario 1 - Checking that the page contains some javascript
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I see that current page contains 'type="text/javascript"'

Scenario 2 - Checking that the page does not contains embedded css
Given
    I go to "page_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I see that current page does not contain "<style"
