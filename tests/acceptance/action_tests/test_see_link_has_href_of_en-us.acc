As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see link has href of action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page link has the given href
Given
	I go to "link_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "lnkGoogle" link has "http://www.google.com" href
	I see "lnkGoogle" link contains "google" in href
	And I see "lnkGoogle2" link has "http://www.google.com" href
	And I see "lnkGoogle2" link contains "google" in href
