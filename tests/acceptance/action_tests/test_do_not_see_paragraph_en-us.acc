As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see paragraph action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page paragraph is not there
Given
    I go to "p_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I do not see "pHidden1" button
    And I do not see "pHidden2" button
    And I do not see "pHidden3" button
    And I do not see "pHidden4" button
    And I do not see "pHidden5" button
