As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see select contains option by text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page's select contains an option of "shrubbery" (using name)
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selContainsOptionByText" select contains an option with text "Shrubbery"

Scenario 2 - Checking that some page's select contains an option of "shrubbery" (using id)
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selContainsOptionByText2" select contains an option with text "Shrubbery"
