As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox does not match text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page textbox does not match text
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "txtMatches1" textbox does not match "Invalid text"
	And I see "txtMatches2" textbox does not match "Invalid text"
	And I see "txtMatches3" textbox does not match "Invalid text"
	And I see "txtMatches4" textbox does not match "Invalid text"
	And I see "txtMatches5" textbox does not match "Invalid text"
	And I see "txtMatches6" textbox does not match "Invalid text"
