As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test textbox is empty
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can see if a textbox does not contain any text
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
    #The page loads
Then
	I see "txtSomething" textbox is empty

Scenario 2 - Checking that we can see if a password box does not contain any text
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
    #The page loads
Then
	I see "passwdSomething" textbox is empty
