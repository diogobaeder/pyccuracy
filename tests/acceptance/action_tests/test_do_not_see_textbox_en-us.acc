As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see textbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page textbox is not there
Given
    I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I see "txtContains6" textbox
    And I click "hide6" button
    And I do not see "txtContains6" textbox
