As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test the mouseover div action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that we can mouseout a div
Given
	I go to "div_tests.htm"
	And I see "divMouseOutChild" div
When
        I mouseover "divMouseOut" div
	And I do not see "divMouseOutChild" div
        And I mouseout "divMouseOut" div
Then
	I see "divMouseOutChild" div
