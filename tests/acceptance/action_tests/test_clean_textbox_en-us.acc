As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test clean textbox action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that I can clean some textbox
Given
	I go to "textbox_tests.htm"
When
    I clean "txtClean1" textbox
    And I clean "txtClean2" textbox
    And I clean "txtClean3" textbox
    And I clean "txtClean4" textbox
    And I clean "txtClean5" textbox
    And I clean "txtClean6" textbox
Then
    I see "txtClean1" textbox is empty
	And I see "txtClean2" textbox is empty
	And I see "txtClean3" textbox is empty
	And I see "txtClean4" textbox is empty
