As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test selecting an option by value
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Changing the selected value of a select to "1"
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	I select the option with value of "1" in "selByValue" select
	And I select the option with value of "1" in "selByValue2" select
Then
	I see "selByValue" select has selected value of "1"
	And I see "selByValue2" select has selected value of "1"
