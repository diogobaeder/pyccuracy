As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test selecting an option by text
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Changing the selected text of a select to "Holy Graal"
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	I select the option with text of "Holy Graal" in "selByText" select
	And I select the option with text of "Holy Graal" in "selByText2" select
Then
	I see "selByText" select has selected text of "Holy Graal"
	And I see "selByText2" select has selected text of "Holy Graal"
