As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test do not see ul action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page ul is not there
Given
    I go to "ul_tests.htm"
When
    #The page finishes loading
Then
    I do not see "ulHidden1" ul
    And I do not see "ulHidden2" ul
    And I do not see "ulHidden3" ul
    And I do not see "ulHidden4" ul
    And I do not see "ulHidden5" ul
