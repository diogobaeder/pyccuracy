As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see div matches markup action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page div matches "<p>some</p> markup" markup
Given
	I go to "div_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "divContainsMarkup" div matches "<p>some</p> markup" markup
