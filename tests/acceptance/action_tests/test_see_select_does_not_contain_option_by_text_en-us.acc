As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test see select does not contain option by text action
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that some page's select does not contain an option of "NI" (using name)
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selContainsOptionByText" select does not contain an option with text "NI"

Scenario 2 - Checking that some page's select does not contain an option of "NI" (using id)
Given
	I go to "select_tests.htm"
When
	#The page finishes loading
Then
	I see "selContainsOptionByText" select does not contain an option with text "NI"
