As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test that you can't wait for a non-existing / invisible div to disappear
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that I can't wait for an element to disappear given that it does not exist
Given
    I go to "baseurlreport.html"
When
    I wait for "divDoesNotExist" div to disappear
Then
    #if it got here something's amiss
