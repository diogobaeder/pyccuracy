As a Pyccuracy User
I want to test that Pyccuracy handles timeout error
So that I can make sure Pyccuracy works

Scenario 1 - Checking that pyccuracy raises the proper exception on timeout
Given
    I go to "test_wait_for_element_error.htm"
When
    I click "btnTest" button and wait
Then
    #if it got here something's screwed up
